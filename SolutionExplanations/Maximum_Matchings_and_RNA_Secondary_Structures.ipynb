    "If we have an RNA string $s$ that does NOT have the same number of occurrences of 'C' (Cytosine) as 'G' (Guanine) and the same number of occurrences of 'A' (Adenine) as 'U' (Uracil), then the bonding graph of $s$ cannot possibly possess a perfect matching among its basepair edges. Therefore, we define a **maximum matching** in a graph as a matching containing as many edges as possible. A maximum matching of basepair edges will correspond to a way of forming as many base pairs as possible in an RNA string.\n",
    "* **bonding graph**: A graph whose nodes represent the symbols of a given RNA string $s$ arranged in order around a circle and whose edges are divided into 2 sets: solid adjacency edges (connecting adjacent nucleotides) and dashed basepair edges (connecting all base pairs).\n",
    "* **perfect matching**: A matching that includes every node in the graph. A graph must contain an even total number of nodes to have a perfect matching.\n",
    "* **basepair edge**: Edges in the bonding graph of an RNA string connecting potential base pairs."
