    "If we have an RNA string $s$ that does NOT have the same number of occurrences of 'C' (Cytosine) as 'G' (Guanine) and the same number of occurrences of 'A' (Adenine) as 'U' (Uracil), then the bonding graph of $s$ cannot possibly possess a perfect matching among its basepair edges. Therefore, we define a **maximum matching** in a graph as a matching containing as many edges as possible. A maximum matching of basepair edges will correspond to a way of forming as many base pairs as possible in an RNA string.\n",
    "* **bonding graph**: A graph whose nodes represent the symbols of a given RNA string $s$ arranged in order around a circle and whose edges are divided into 2 sets: solid adjacency edges (connecting adjacent nucleotides) and dashed basepair edges (connecting all base pairs).\n",
    "* **perfect matching**: A matching that includes every node in the graph. A graph must contain an even total number of nodes to have a perfect matching.\n",

    "The question is asking for the total possible number of maximum matchings of basepair edges in the bodning graph of a given $s.$ Basically, it's asking for the all the possible **number of ways** that we can form maximum matchings. For example, if the given $s$ is 'CAGCGUGAUCAC', then the answer would be 144, because there are 144 different, possible ways of forming the maximum matchings in the bonding graph of $s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:<br>\n",
    "First, we can get the total possible ways of forming maximum matchings by getting all the different ways of forming A-U pairs AND all the different ways of forming G-C pairs. The way we calculate the number of all the different ways of forming A-U pairs given an RNA string is the same as that of forming G-C pairs given an RNA string. Then, how do we calculate the number of all the different ways of forming A-U pairs? For RNA string 'CAGCGUGAUCAC', for each of the 3 A's, there are 2 different U's that it can pair with. Let's label each A's as $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$, and each U's as $U_1$, and $U_2$. Then, there are 3 $C$ 2 number of ways to choose which of the 2 A's to pair with 2 of the U's. Once we choose which 2 A's to pair with 2 U's, then there are  $2!$ ways of pairing each of the chosen 2 A's with 2 U's. For example, let's say that we chose $A_1$ and $A_2$ to pair with $U_1$ and $U_2$. Then, the first A to form a pair with a U would have 2 choices of U's that it could pair with. Once the first A forms a pair with one of the U's, then the second A would have only 1 way to pair with the remaining U, which translates to $2! = 2 \\times 1$. \n",
