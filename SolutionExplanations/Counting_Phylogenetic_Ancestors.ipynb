Modern evolutionary theory indicates that a common way for a new species to be created is when it splits off from an existing species after a population is isolated for an extended period of time.

    "Based on Full Binary Tree theorem, if we let T be a nonempty, full binary tree, then if T has I internal nodes, the number of leaves is $L = I + 1$. This theorem applies for rooted full binary trees. Since in this problem, we are given $n \\ (n = L)$, which is the number of leaves, we could obtain the number of internal nodes by calculating $I = n - 1$. However, in this problem, we are talking about unrooted full binary tree. Therefore, since we won't have the root node, we'd have to subtract 1 node; therefore, the number of internal nodes for an unrooted full binary tree would be given by this equation: $I = n - 2$."
