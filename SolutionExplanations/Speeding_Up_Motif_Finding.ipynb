    "### Shortening the Motif Search\n",
    "* **Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm**: An algorithm for motif finding first published in 1977. It improved on the naive \"sliding window\" approach to finding a motif by introducing the **failure array**.\n",
    "* **Failure Array**: A failure array (often called a failure function) is an array employed in the KMP algorithm to speed up motif finding in strings. Specifically, given a string $s$, its failure array $P$ is constructed so that $P[k]$ is equal to the length of the longest substring of $s$ ending at $k$ that isn't a prefix but is equal to some prefix $s[1:i]$, where $i$ must be less than $k$. For example, given the string \"CAGTAAGCAGGGACTG\", its failure array is given by $[0000000123000100]$.\n",

    "Because of the large scale of eukaryotic genomes, we need to search a genome for a known motif as efficiently as possible. The standard method for locating one string $t$ as a substring of another string $s$ is to move a sliding window across the larger string, at each step starting at $s[k]$ and matching subsequent symbols of $t$ to symbols of $s$. After we have located a match or mismatch, we then shift the window backwards to begin searching at $s[k+1]$. The potential weakness of this method is that, for example, if we have matched 100 symbols of $t$ to $s$ before reaching a mismatch, we would then have to move back 99 symbols of $s$ and start comparing $t$ to $s$. To avoid this kind of sliding, we can explore the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm (KMP)**, which offers an efficiency boost for determining whether a given motif can be located within a larger string."

    "A prefix of a length $n$ string $s$ is a substring $s[1:j]$. A suffix of $s$ is a substring $s[k:n]$.

Otherwise, $P[k]$ would always equal $k$. By convention, $P[1] = 0$."

    "Given a text of string $s$ and a pattern string $t$, we want to find out whether the pattern string $t$ exists as a substring in string $s$. With the naive approach, this pattern matching would take $O(m \\times n)$ time, where $m$ is the length of $s$ and $n$ is the length of $t$. However, fortunately, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm provides a way where we can solve this problem in $O(m+n)$ time complexity.<br>\n",

In order to keep track of this, the KNP algorithm generates a pi table (_failure array_ as mentioned above), where the pi is also called as 'LPS' (longest prefix that is the same as the suffix)."
