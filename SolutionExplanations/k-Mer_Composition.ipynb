    "A genetic string of length $n$ can be seen as composed of $n - k + 1$ overlapping k-mers. The 1-mer composition is a generalization of the GC-content of a strand of DNA. The biological significance of a k-mer composition is manyfold. GC-content is helpful not only in helping to identify a piece of unknown DNA, but also because a genomic region having high GC-content compared to the rest of the genome signals that it may belong to an **exon**. Analyzing k-mer composition is vital to **fragment assembly** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger values of $k$, the k-mer composition offers a more robust fingerprint of a string's identity because it offers an analysis on the scale of substrings (i.e. words) instead of that of single symbols. As a basis of comparison, in language analysis, the k-mer composition of a text can be used not only to pin down the language, but also often the author."
